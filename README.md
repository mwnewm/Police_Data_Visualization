# Keene, NH Data Visualization Prototype

This project was built as a companion to my 2021 undergraduate thesis at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst Commonwealth Honors College entitled: Visualizing New England Policing Data: an Investigation into Implicit Racial Bias and Police Data Management.

The application makes use of demographic policing data publicly available on the Keene, NH Police Department website, along with the most recent U.S. Census data available. The project was built with the purpose of aiding transparency in police activities and improving overall usability and clarity of police data.

The full prototype application can be viewed at:
